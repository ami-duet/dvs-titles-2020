## To run the project locally
1. In bash/terminal/command line, `cd` into your project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install required files and dependencies.
3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
	- `gulp` manually compiles files.
	- `gulp watch` automatically compiles files and applies changes using [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/) when you make changes to your source files.
